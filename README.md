# DeepBSDE_Thesis
Pricing European call spread options with different interest rates for borrowing and lending using backward stochastic differential equations and deep learning.

Three problems are implemented, `EuropeanPut`, `EuropeanCallDiffRate` and `EuropeanCallSpread`. To run, use the class name as an argument:
```
python3 deepbsde.py EuropeanCallSpread
```
